              Imbalances in electricity supply and demand are a significant
              problem in developing countries resulting in rolling
              blackouts/load shedding. Due to the inconvenience caused by
              blackouts, several brownout (partial blackout) strategies have
              been proposed. In this paper, we resort to keeping the electricity
              demand of a household within a specified threshold. Our approach
              combines two distinct methods of end-point load (appliance)
              control: priority-based techniques and combinatorial
              optimization-based techniques to create a hybrid approach that
              gives users flexibility in configuring their preferences
              on-the-fly. We have quantified the user preferences using the
              Analytical Hierarchy Process, which is useful for solving such
              Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problems.
